# Thoro/bfd configuration for interoperability testing with GoBFD.
#
# Thoro/bfd listens on 0.0.0.0:3784 by default (if no listen addresses
# successfully bind, Serve() creates a default listener).
#
# Config format (from README):
#   interval: the interval that packets are sent in ms
#   detectionMultiplier: after how many missed packets is the peer declared down
#
# Note: Thoro/bfd has a bug where DesiredMinTxInterval on wire is the config
# value (ms) rather than microseconds. The actual send interval is negotiated
# as max(local.desired, remote.required) so this is harmless in practice:
# GoBFD sends RequiredMinRxInterval=300000us which dominates.
