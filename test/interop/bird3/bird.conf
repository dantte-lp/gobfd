# BIRD3 configuration for BFD interoperability testing with GoBFD.
#
# Configures a BFD protocol with a single neighbor pointing to the
# gobfd container at 172.20.0.10. Intervals are 300ms with multiplier 3,
# giving a detection time of 900ms (RFC 5880 Section 6.8.3).
#
# BIRD3 does not require a routing protocol to run BFD standalone.
# The "direct" protocol discovers connected routes for the test network.
